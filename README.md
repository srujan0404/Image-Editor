# Image-Editor
****Image Processing Tool****
This is a simple Java program for basic image processing tasks. As a beginner, this code allows us to perform various operations on an image
such as increasing/decreasing brightness, converting to grayscale, rotating, blurring, and mirroring horizontally or vertically.
*****Usage******
Once you run the program, you'll be prompted to provide input and output paths for your image. After loading the image successfully, you can choose from the following operations:
**Increase Brightness:** This option allows you to increase the brightness of the image.
**Decrease Brightness:** Decrease the brightness of the image.
**Grayscale:** Convert the image to grayscale.
**Rotate:** Rotate the image by a specified number of degrees (e.g., 90 degrees clockwise).
**Blur:** Apply a blur effect to the image. You can specify the blur radius.
**Mirror Horizontally:** Mirror the image horizontally.
**Mirror Vertically:** Mirror the image vertically.
**Exit:** Exit the program.
****Example****
Let's say you have an image called input.jpg that you want to process. 
You can provide the input path as input.jpg and choose one of the operations. 
If you choose to increase brightness, the processed image will be saved as output.jpg (you can specify the output path). You can then view the processed image.
